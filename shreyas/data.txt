Heavy intermittent spells of rainfall have been lashing Mumbai since yesterday. The water logging in several low-lying areas like Kalyan, 
Nala Sopara, Mira Bhayender, Badlapur etc have thrown life out of gear, but mutely suffering the situation are stray animals and bovines
stuck in stables. A twitter user shared these pictures to show the plight of buffaloes stuck at a Kalyan stable this morning.
